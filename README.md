# Important
### This setup guide is a simple guide for me, the writer, to follow when i need to install a fresh arch system, this is a very biased guide towards my Acer Aspire 5 514-54 computer, this means that i do not claim for this to work on most computers or any computer, this is just the stuff i have to do to make my arch system run on my laptop.

### So with that, this is NOT:

- An installation guide u should prob follow, instead go to: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide
- A guide on how to install arch the best way or the least bloeated way
- An experts guide

### This IS:

- A guide on how i installed my arch system in my laptop
- Visual clarification on how to do certain stuff in dwm etc..
- A repository made for myself so i can just git clone my whole configuration on a fresh install and run a simple bash script to install everything
- How to aproach problems in arch from a begginers perspective

This repo will include some "hosekeeping" bash scripts i created, they include but are not limited to:

- Status bar
- Backlight Brightness controller
- Multiple monitor layout
- Battery % monitor so it doenst fully descharge


Also the necessary config files such as:

- .xinitrc
- bash_rc
- xbindkeysrc
- bash_profile
- config.def.h (dwm,dmenu,st)
- pacman depedency list


Also some read-me files to remember how to mount disks,fstab stuff, nmcli commands, etc..
